    <h3>Poema 3</h3>
    <p>I can&rsquo;t help myself with these poems, If poems are what they are &ndash; A few words that become a torrent and then subside, Well up again, Captured before they ebb away for all eternity: And in that capture I find some primitive release, A longing absolved, A pent-up problem solved.</p>
