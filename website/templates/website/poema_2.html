    <h3>Poema 2</h3>
    <p>The sea stirs silent in a ripple On meddled shore, still dream hung, sun worn, Ships outdone by a shadowed pall As they sit like giant ghosts on the horizon.</p>

    <p>In the beckoning of our nets shrimps flick dismay invisibly, Fleet sand sparks leaving clouds of smoke To tell us that they&rsquo;ve gone</p>
